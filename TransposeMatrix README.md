# Transpose of a Matrix (Java)

This Java program demonstrates how to find the transpose of a given matrix (2D array).

## Overview

The `TransposeMatrix` class contains two primary methods:

-   `transpose(int[][] matrix)`: This method calculates the transpose of a given matrix and returns the transposed matrix.
-   `printMatrix(int[][] matrix)`: This method prints the elements of a given matrix to the console.

The `main` method demonstrates the usage of these functions with a sample matrix and prints the original and transposed matrices.

## Features

-   Handles null or empty matrices, returning an empty matrix in such cases.
-   Calculates the transpose of a matrix by swapping its rows and columns.
-   Provides a utility method to print matrices in a readable format.
-   Clear and concise code with comments explaining each step.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Compilation and Execution

1.  **Save the file:** Save the provided Java code as `TransposeMatrix.java`.

2.  **Compile the code:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the following command:

    ```bash
    javac TransposeMatrix.java
    ```

3.  **Run the code:** After successful compilation, execute the program using the following command:

    ```bash
