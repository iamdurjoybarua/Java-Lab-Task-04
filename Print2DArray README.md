# Print 2D Array (Java)

This Java program demonstrates how to print all elements of a given 2D integer array.

## Overview

The `Print2DArray` class contains a method `print2DArray(int[][] arr)` that iterates through a 2D array and prints each element to the console, row by row.

The `main` method demonstrates the usage of this function with a sample 2D array.

## Features

-   Handles null or empty 2D arrays, printing an error message in such cases.
-   Iterates through the 2D array and prints each element with spaces between elements in the same row.
-   Prints a newline character after each row to maintain the 2D structure in the output.
-   Clear and concise code with comments explaining each step.
