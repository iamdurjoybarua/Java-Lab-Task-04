# Sum of Elements in a 2D Array (Java)

This Java program calculates the sum of all elements in a given 2D integer array.

## Overview

The `Sum2DArray` class contains a method `calculateSum(int[][] arr)` that iterates through a 2D array and calculates the sum of all its elements.

The `main` method demonstrates the usage of this function with a sample 2D array and prints the calculated sum.

## Features

-   Handles null or empty 2D arrays, returning 0 in such cases.
-   Iterates through the 2D array and calculates the sum of all elements.
-   Returns the total sum of the elements.
-   Clear and concise code with comments explaining each step.
